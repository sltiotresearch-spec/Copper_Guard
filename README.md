# 🛡️Copper_Guard
Copper Guard is an IoT-based copper cable protection system that detects wire cuts or failures and instantly sends SMS and call alerts using ESP12F (ESP8266) and SIM800C GSM module.

When a wire is cut or disabled:
- 📩 An SMS alert is sent
- 📞 A phone call notification is triggered

The system evolved through four hardware versions, improving scalability, connectivity, and reliability.
